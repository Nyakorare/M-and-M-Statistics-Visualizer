# M&M Statistics Visualizer

A web-based modeling and simulation tool that visualizes and analyzes the distribution of M&M colors in a pack. This project demonstrates statistical concepts through an interactive and engaging interface.

## Overview

This application allows users to:
- Input counts of M&Ms by color
- Generate random M&M distributions
- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Visualize data through interactive charts
- Gain insights about the distribution patterns

## Features

### Interactive Input
- Color-coded input fields for each M&M color (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Brown)
- Real-time visual feedback with animated M&M icons
- Input validation to ensure non-negative numbers

### Statistical Analysis
- Calculates key statistical measures:
  - Total count
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation

### Data Visualization
- Interactive bar chart showing M&M distribution
- Color-coded bars matching M&M colors
- Percentage calculations for each color
- Hover effects for detailed information

### Random Pack Generation
- Simulates opening a new pack of 50 M&Ms
- Cooldown timer to prevent rapid generation
- Confirmation dialog when replacing existing data

### Insights
- Provides detailed analysis of the distribution
- Highlights significant deviations from expected values
- Identifies most and least common colors

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Tailwind CSS)
- JavaScript
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Animate.css for animations

### Key Components
1. **Input Form**
   - Responsive grid layout
